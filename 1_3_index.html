                    <h3>Pork belly</h3>
                    It refers to the part of the belly of a pig attached near the ribs of a pig. It is called pork belly 
                    because the fat looks overlapped in three layers. Looking at the appearance, it is in the order of 
                    fat-fleshed meat-fleshed meat-fleshed meat-fleshed meat. It is to eat a back wall consisting of three layers 
                    of muscles, such as the outside of the belly, the belly root, and the belly root.

                    In Korea, it is the most preferred pork part to the extent that it is considered the number one preference 
                    menu at restaurants or company dinners. Domestic production alone is tight enough to meet demand and imports a lot, 
                    but as of 2020, the proportion of pork belly (128,000 tons) in pork imports is more than twice that of second-largest 
                    wooden core (54,000 tons). It is usually made of grilled pork belly and eaten wrapped in sesame leaves or lettuce.
