        <p>Hanbok is a unique clothing of Korea that has been handed down since ancient times. Most commoners enjoyed wearing white clothes, 
            and the basic composition of hanbok, skirts, jeogori, and pants, remained unchanged for a long time. 
            There are several characteristics that appear in Hanbok as a lucky charm. Basically, they value activity and are not tight clothes. 
            In addition, if you look at the fabric itself, it is straight, but there is also an aesthetic feature that helps the curve revive 
            when worn on the body, which is also because it has a pocketless structure. Unlike traditional clothes from neighboring countries 
            such as kimono and hanfu, not hobok, hanbok is divided into jeogori and skirt, that is, upper and lower clothes, and is divided 
            into shapes.

            Modern hanbok is usually similar to hanbok worn during the Joseon Dynasty and is often worn on holidays or formal occasions. 
            modernized hanbok emphasizes the convenience of life, so its appearance has undergone several changes during the 20th century. 
            Hanbok is also a clothing, so it is not as fast as ready-made clothes, but this attempt is still being attempted by various hanbok 
            designers, combining colors, materials, and features according to the trend of the times and the needs of the public.
