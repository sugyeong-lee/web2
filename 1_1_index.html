                    <h3>Korea?</h3>
                    A democratic republic located in the central and southern parts of the Korean Peninsula in the northeastern part of the Asian continent.

                    <h3>Language</h3>
                    The official language of South Korea is Korean. Unlike English, the National Institute of Korean Language stipulates 
                    the norms of the official language, that is, the standard language, like France, where there is an institution 
                    called Academy Franais. The dialects include Gyeonggi dialect, Chungcheong dialect, Yeongseo dialect, Yeongdong dialect, 
                    southwest dialect, southeast dialect, and Jeju dialect, and Jeju dialect is classified into other languages 
                    because of the large difference from other Korean dialects. In modern times, dialects are on the decline due to being pushed to the standard language, 
                    but even in the younger generation in their 20s, they sometimes use dialect accents or vocabulary rather than the standard language. 
                    Unlike in the past, when dialects were officially considered to be words that need to be corrected, 
                    the National Institute of Korean Language has also expressed efforts to promote dialects since 2006.

                    <h3>Geography?</h3>
                    <img src="C:\Users\653dl\Web_programming\1_1_img\Map.jpeg" align="right" vspace = "20" hspace="50" width="200" height="200" alt = "사진 없음">
                    It is bordered by the People's Republic of China and the Yellow Sea to the west, Japan and the East Sea to the east, and North Korea and the Korean Peninsula to the north. As a result of the fault and Yogok movement that took place after the 3rd Maiose, 
                    the Korean Peninsula is approaching the east coast with a steep slope in the east, and the altitude gradually decreases to the west. 
                    This is called the Gyeongdong topography of Donggo West and West. Most of the high mountains are located in the Taebaek Mountains, 
                    called the backbone of the Korean Peninsula, as they are biased toward the eastern region. Seoraksan Mountain is the representative 
                    mountain of the Taebaek Mountains. The Sobaeksan Mountain Range continues to the southwest of the Taebaeksan Mountain Range, and Jirisan 
                    Mountain is famous among them. Jeju Island has Hallasan Mountain, the highest mountain and extinct volcano in Korea.
                    The west of the Korean Peninsula faces the Yellow Sea, the east faces the East Sea, and the south faces the South Sea, 
                    so it is a peninsula surrounded by the sea on three sides, and East China Sea is in contact with the south of Jeju Island, 
                    the largest annex. The coast of the Yellow Sea and the South Sea is a rias-style coast with complicated coastline, and the difference 
                    between the tides is large, and the coastal topography is quite flat, resulting in a wide tidal flat. It is also called Dadohae 
                    because there are many islands. On the other hand, most of the coasts of the East Sea are monotonous, deep, 
                    and there is little difference in the tide. Sand dunes and lagoons are formed near the coast, Ulleungdo Island, 
                    a volcanic island in the distant sea, and Dokdo Island, Korea's easternmost island, is located about 87.4km east of it. 
                    Flatlands were developed in the west.

                    <h3>Climate?</h3>
                    It ranges from 33 degrees to 38 degrees north latitude and 126 to 132 degrees east longitude, 
                    resulting in a cold winter cow climate, a temperate Howe climate, and a warm and humid climate. 
                    In winter, the northern region is dry and very cold due to the influence of the Siberian and 
                    Mongolian highlands due to the westerly winds, but the southern region is relatively warm due to this influence. 
                    In summer, it is high-temperature and humid due to the influence of the Pacific Ocean and shows 
                    the characteristics of a marine climate. The seasons are clearly shown in four seasons, and summer and 
                    winter are generally long in the northern part, and spring and autumn are long in the southern region. 
                    Warm spring weather from early March to early May, hot summer from May to early August, sunny and 
                    dry autumn weather from late August to late October, and cold and dry winter weather from December 
                    to February begins to gradually decrease in November. Except for the central mountainous region, 
                    the average annual temperature is generally 10 to 16℃, with the hottest month, August 23 to 36℃, 
                    May 16 to 19℃, October 11 to 19℃, and January, the coldest month, -6 to 3℃. Rain usually falls a lot in summer, 
                    and 50 to 60% of the annual precipitation is concentrated at this time. This is called the rainy season, 
                    and especially from late June to mid-July is called the rainy season. The average annual precipitation 
                    in each region is 1100 to 1400 mm in the central region, 1000 to 1800 mm in the southern region, 
                    and 1000 to 1200 mm in the Gyeongbuk region. The coastal area of Gyeongsangnam-do is about 1800 mm, 
                    and Jeju Island is 1450 to 1850 mm. Humidity is high in July and August, so it is about 80% across the country, 
                    and about 70% in September and October. About 28 typhoons occur annually in the western North Pacific Ocean, 
                    two or three of which are affected.
