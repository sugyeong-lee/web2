                    Little Forest, a movie that captures the four slow seasons out of 
                    the city with delicious seasonal food. If I were a modern person, 
                    I would imagine living like Hyewon at least once. Of course, 
                    there are practical restrictions for all of us to live as Hyewon, 
                    but you can feel like Hyewon and her friends for a while at the filming 
                    location of the movie "Little Forest" located in Gunwi, Gyeongsangbuk-do.

                    <h3>The time when the camellia blooms : Guryongpo, Pohang</h3>
                    Since the drama "When the Camellia Blooms" became popular, the hot search 
                    word is "When the Camellia Blooms"! The filming location of "When the Camellia Blooms" 
                    that attracted many tourists after the end is Guryongpo Japanese House Street in Pohang. 
                    From Camellia that Camellia and Yongsik are likely to greet, to Ongsan Gejang Alley 
                    guarded by Ongvengers! It is a very nice Pohang travel destination to meet familiar 
                    backgrounds in the drama.

                    <h3>Hotel Del Luna : Buyeo Sungheungsanseong Fortress</h3>
                    This is the love tree of Seongheungsanseong Fortress in Buyeo, where CEO Jang Man-wol's past 
                    life memory in the drama Hotel Del Luna appeared. Seongheungsanseong Fortress Sarang Tree was 
                    famous as a sacred place for couples even before the airing of Hotel Del Luna. The reason is 
                    that if you take a picture of the bent tree trunk while drawing a parabola, it becomes 
                    a heart shape if it is symmetrical. Because of this special meaning, if you are planning 
                    a unique and memorable domestic trip, I recommend stopping by the Love Tree of 
                    Seongheungsanseong Fortress in Buyeo.

                    The love tree of Seongheungsanseong Fortress in Buyeo is located high and is famous 
                    for its scenery is also famous for its beautiful scenery. Depending on the time you 
                    take pictures of the scenery, you can also take pictures under natural light during 
                    the day and with sunset in the late afternoon, and mysterious pictures after sunset.

                    <h3>Mr. Sunshine: Nonsan Sunshine Studio</h3>
                    I want to take a special picture, but for those who feel awkward and hesitant 
                    about the indoor studio, I recommend a trip to Nonsan Sunshine Studio. 
                    Nonsan Sunshine Studio, the filming location of the drama "Mr. Sunshine," 
                    is a drama open-set theme park that reproduces Hansung during the flowering 
                    period from sets to the streets, such as the Glory Hotel and the Bullanshire 
                    bakery in the drama. The advantage of the drama open set like Sunshine Studio 
                    is that you can go around every corner and experience it as if you are the main 
                    character. One more thing, the filming location of Mr. Sunshine has a clear pre-era 
                    concept of enlightenment, so it's good to go play even if you haven't watched the drama. Also, it would be fun to look for wits that are melted in places like Paris Baguette → French Bakers, right?

                    <h3>Goblin: Jumunjin Beach in Gangneung</h3>
                    One of the best scenes that comes to mind when you think of the drama 
                    "Guardian: The Lonely and Great God," Kim Go-eun stood face to face with 
                    a buckwheat flower in a red scarf. The background of this famous scene is 
                    Jumunjin Beach in Gangneung. After appearing as a goblin, Jumunjin Beach 
                    in Gangneung, which was originally famous, is said to be crowded with domestic 
                    and foreign tourists gathered to take a proof shot of a parody of the goblin. 
                    It's a must-see course if you travel to Gangneung, a place that's not famous for 
                    no reason.
